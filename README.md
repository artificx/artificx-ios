# Version 1.0.2 of Artificx iOS App

## V 1.0.2 Changes
- Bug fixes

- Improved page navigation

## IMPORTANT
ARKit does not run on iOS simulations or ealier iPhones. As a result, the app will not build. In order to run the program with the AR feature on these devices, comment out lines 19 and lines 62-end (use CMD-/ so that double-commented lines stay commented), and un-comment line 20
